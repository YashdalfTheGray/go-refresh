# go-refresh

Refreshing golang knowledge by writing random golang

## building

Standard go project but has `go mod` support. So just need a `go build -o bin/go-refresh` to get started.

## running

Running the whole binary just takes running `./bin/go-refresh`.

## Cleaning

Just a simple `rm -rf ./bin` will clean all the built things.

## `build-and-run`

There is a script that builds all the code to the right place and then runs the binary.
